Hi team,

I wrote this up real quick to help you guys work using this repository. The first thing you'll want to do is download SourceTree.
https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

It's made by the same people behind BitBucket so it will work well together.

Once SourceTree is installed go ahead and clone this repository to your local machine. Then you can start working!
In case you need it, these are the root directories of our repositories:
https://bitbucket.org/csi-3471/csi-3471-website/src/
https://bitbucket.org/csi-3471/csi-3471-software/src/

Keep in mind that this is the master branch so make sure you test changes well before pushing here!

The next thing we need to use is a plugin for BitBucket called Time Spent by Easysecrets.
As the name suggests this will help us track the amount of time each has worked on the repository.

That should be about it, I went ahead and added Time Spent but I'll need to make sure it is working later. So let me know if it is
working for you. You can read about it here:
